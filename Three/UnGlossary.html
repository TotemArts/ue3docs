This can include things as simple as non interactive scripted sequences to things as complex as computer characters that learn from player actions and adapt.
<p />
<strong>AI Controller</strong> - A class that defines how a computer controlled characters or a group of computer controlled characters behave.
<p />
<strong>Alpha Channel</strong> - An extra channel in a texture that allows for not only transparency but also translucency in a texture.

<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
- The version of the Unreal Editor. For example: UT2003 uses the 2136 <em>Build</em> of the Engine and UT2004 uses the 3186 <em>Build</em> of the Engine. Unreal Engin3 3 is distributed in QA-Approved Builds (<a href="https://udn.epicgames.com/Three/BuildUpgradeNotes" class="restricted" class="restricted" class="twikiLink">Release Notes</a>).

<p />
<a name="BsP"></a>
<strong>BSP</strong> - Binary Space Partitioning (sometimes refered to as <em>CSG</em> ) is a data structure that is used to organize objects within a space of the level. While it is not semantically correct to use this term to refer to geometry, it is loosely accepted as referring to the geometry created with the builder brush. For more on <em>BSP,</em> see the <a href="UsingBspBrushes.html" class="twikiLink">Using BSP Brushes</a> document.<br>
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  In simpler words, <em>BSP</em> is a type of geometry that can be added or subtracted from a level to sculpt the space of the environment.
<p />
<strong>BSP Holes</strong> - Inexplicable breaks in the BSP geometry where subtractive and additive BSP spaces spill into each other. They can occur in highly complicated BSP additions/subtractions. In addition to slowing down the frame rate of a scene, they have been known cause other more strange problems including but not limited to disappearing staticmeshes and invisible player blocking walls.
<p />
<a name="CcC"></a>

<p />
<strong>CollisionCylinder</strong> - The cylindrical space around every actor that can be used to determine collisions. For many actors, this setting is by default turned off but for other actors such as the player and triggers, the <em>CollisionCylinder</em> is on be default and detects when other actors collide with it. The height and radius of the <em>CollisionCylinder</em> can be altered under the collision properties tab.
<p />
<strong>Collision Model</strong> - Less complicated geometric volumes that are created along with and stored in a staticmesh. The <em>Collision Model</em> is used to facilitate faster collision calculations than would be possible with just a complex staticmesh.

<p />
<a name="LevelS"></a>
<a name="LeveL"></a>
<strong>Level</strong> - A level defines a set of actors and other complex data that can be loaded and unloaded atomically. The world in Unreal Engine 3 may consist of many levels; a typical game may contain several hundred individual levels. These levels may be dynamically loaded and unloaded based on proximity, explicit load/unload triggers, and other criteria. For more info on levels, see the <a href="CreatingLevels.html" class="twikiLink">Creating Levels</a> and <a href="LevelStreamingHowTo.html" class="twikiLink">Level Streaming</a> documents.

<p />
<strong>LOD</strong> - (Level of Detail) A feature that allows the resolution of the geometry to decrease over distance in order to increase the frame rate of a scene (specifically in animated characters). For more on how to use <em>LOD</em> on models, see the <a href="StaticMeshEditorUserGuide.html" class="twikiLink">Static Mesh Editor User Guide</a> document.
<p />
<strong>Log</strong> - A window that prints out actions either in game or in the editor that shows every action that takes place.
<p />

<a name="MaP"></a>
<strong>Map</strong> - The file that is saved which contains all of the placed actor properties and thus the layout of the entire scene you've created.
<p />

<p />
<strong>Material</strong> - A tool used for creating special effects with textures. <em>Materials</em> show up and can be browsed in the texture browser  and they are also saved in texture packages. For more on using the different types of <em>Materials</em> see the <a href="MaterialsTutorial.html" class="twikiLink">Texturing and Materials</a> document.
<p />
<strong>Matinee</strong> - An in-editor keyframing tool that allows one to move objects and change properties in the game. You can also use it for camera paths and to create in-game cut scenes.

<p />
<strong>Mod</strong> - User-created content that is largely based on another commercial game (such as Unreal Tournament) but is modified to create a different, or <em>modified</em>, game play experience.
<p />
<strong>Modifier</strong> - A material that can modify a texture or another material in a variety of ways including (but not limited to) allowing it to pan, waiver, rotate, and scale.
<p />
<strong>Mover</strong> - A special staticmesh that can be assigned keyframes within the editor and then assigned to move along a path determined by these keyframes when triggered by an event such as player collision, weapon fire, or a trigger.
<p />
<strong>Music</strong> - Song files that can be added to a level to be played in the background or Triggered after an event. These song files must be in the .ogg file format.
<p />
<a name="NoO"></a>
<h1><a name="N  O"></a> N &amp; O </h1>
<strong>NonZeroExtentTraces</strong> - A trace that uses a box traveling along a line to determine collision. In other words, instead of using casting a 2 dimensional line to determine if a line can be drawn between two points, a 3 dimensional box is cast along a line to see what will impede the box.
<p />
<strong>Notifies</strong> - A call that can be placed at any point in a given animation that can trigger another event including but not limited to spawning sounds, particle systems, or executing UnrealScript functions. Foot steps sounds that are played when a foot reaches the ground in an walk animation are a good example of <em>Notifies</em>.
<p />
<strong>Novodex</strong> - The rigid body physics engine used in Unreal Engine 3 to simulate realistic movement and collision between objects. Novodex is also used by the vehicle system in UE3. Novodex is owned by Ageia, and have a web site at <a href="http://www.ageia.com" target="_top">http://www.ageia.com</a>. See PhysX.
<p />
<strong>Outer</strong> - For Objects stored in packages Outer is usually the group or package they are in. For those stored in the level the Outer is the level.
<p />
<strong>Order</strong> - See <a href="UnGlossary.html#SortinG" class="twikiAnchorLink">Sorting</a>.

<p />
<strong>Pass</strong> - One time that the scene is drawn in the renderer. A scene can require several <em>Passes</em> by the renderer before it is drawn to the screen. In other words, if a triangle is requires 3 passes, it is being drawn 3 times by the renderer.
<p />
<strong>Path Node</strong> - A point in a network of lines that determine where a bot can travel to. <em>Path Nodes</em> appear as apples in the editor. For more information on <em>Path Nodes,</em> see the NavigationAI document.
<p />
<strong>Pawn</strong> - A character or class that can navigate (either on its own or by player control) through the level.
<p />
<strong>PhAT</strong> - The Physics Asset Tool, part of the Editor, which is used for creating <a href="UnGlossary.html#PhysicsAsset" class="twikiAnchorLink">PhysicsAssets</a>. PhAT allows you to take a skeletal mesh, and assign collision shapes and joints to the bones. It also allows you to preview the physics setup in real time and interact with it. You can see more PhAT in the <a href="PhATUserGuide.html" class="twikiLink">Physics Asset Tool(PhAT)</a> document.
<p />
<strong>PhysicsAsset</strong> - A collection of collision shapes and joint setups which make up the physics information about a skeletal mesh. An example would be a ragdoll setup, but you can also use PhysicsAssets to represent the physics of any articulated object. PhysicsAssets are also used to update the bounding box of the skeletal mesh, and can be used for per-bone hit detection. <a href="UnGlossary.html#PhAT" class="twikiAnchorLink">PhAT</a> is the tool used for creating Physics Assets.
<p />
<strong>PhysX</strong> - The physics engine by Ageia (formerly Novodex) which was integrated into Unreal Engine 3.
