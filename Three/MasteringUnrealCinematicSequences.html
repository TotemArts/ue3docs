<h1><a name="Chapter 21: Creating Cinematic Sequences"></a> <b>Chapter 21: Creating Cinematic Sequences</b> </h1>
<p />
<h2><a name="What is a Cinematic Sequence?"></a> What is a Cinematic Sequence? </h2>
<p />
Cinematic sequences, often called cut-scenes or Machinima, are essentially short virtual films that are shown as intermissions between levels or missions, as prologues to the next level, or as epilogues to the level that has just been completed. Most often, these are completely non-interactive as the player has limited to no control over the action that happens or the manner in which they experience the cinematic. Cinematic sequences provide the designers and art directors with the power to present the story precisely in the manner they wish the player to receive it.
<p />
While cinematic sequences are a primary a way for game designers to push character development and explain the storyline with complete control, they do present some considerable challenges; especially those that are completely non-interactive. Keeping the viewer interested and entertained is extremely important, but will often prove difficult at the same time. If at all possible, you want to avoid having the scene devolve into a series of talking heads. This becomes more difficult when there is a lot of info to convey to the player, such as mission objectives or integral story lines. Keeping the scene moving is a great way to keep the action flowing and keep the player's attention when they are not in control. This can be done using a combination of moving the actors, moving the camera, or moving through edits, such as camera cuts.
<p />
<h3><a name="Moving the Actors"></a> Moving the Actors </h3>
<p />
Moving the actors is fairly self-explanatory. In essence, as the director, you are moving the characters in the scene around to keep the scene from being monotonous and stale. This not only creates the feeling of action taking place even when the camera is relatively static, but also creates opportunities for the other methods, camera movement and camera edits.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-002.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.1 – This diagram illustrates the actors of a scene moving about while the camera remains stationary.</font></strong>
<p />
<h3><a name="Moving the Camera"></a> Moving the Camera </h3>
<p />
Moving the camera refers to physically trucking the camera around in space during the sequence. This is a great way to make use of single-camera shots while keeping the scene lively. It also presents the opportunity to display the environments in which the characters in the scene find themselves.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-001.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.2 – This diagram illustrates the camera moving about or through the scene.</font></strong>
<p />
<h3><a name="Moving Through Edits"></a> Moving Through Edits </h3>
<p />
Moving through edits refers mainly to the use of camera cuts, but also to fading and zooming or even the use of slow-motion. Any or all of these editing techniques can be used to keep the scene moving and interesting to the player. In larger scenes where the characters are more spaced out, it may be difficult or even impossible to shift focus from one character to another simply through moving the camera or moving the actors themselves. Having multiple cameras and cutting between them can be invaluable in situations like these.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-003.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.3 – This diagram shows multiple cameras focusing on the subjects.  These cameras could then be cut in between using edits.</font></strong>
<p />
<h3><a name="Rendered In-Game vs. Pre-Rendered"></a> Rendered In-Game vs. Pre-Rendered </h3>
<p />
One of the aspects of cut scenes – especially in the past – that has put off some gamers and enticed others is the distinction between in-game cinematic sequences and pre-rendered sequences.  In-game cinematics are produced in real time and are rendered using the game's own art assets and rendering engine.  Pre-rendered cinematics are different in that they are created using separate high resolution art assets and are generally created with and rendered out from 3D applications.  The resulting movie is simply played back as a movie in the game.
<p />
With the advent of Unreal Engine 3 and the quality of its rendering system, the lines between these techniques have blurred.  The art assets used in-game – and therefore in the in-game cinematics – have the same high visual fidelity as the high resolution art assets used in many modern films.  The Matinee system has also been completely overhauled, turning it  into a fully featured non-linear editor. Cinematic sequences which rival the quality previously only found in pre-rendering in the past can now be created directly inside of UnrealEd and rendered in realtime as the game plays, and can be created much more easily.
<p />
What this means for developers is art assets can now be shared between the game and the cinematic sequences used in the game as well as those used for marketing purposes. This means less time spent working on the cinematic sequences in-house or less money spent outsourcing the creation of the cinematics to other studios. It also means that there is no gap between the look of the cinematic sequences and the actual gameplay. This has been a sticking point for gamers for the longest time. The commercial for a game would look amazingly lifelike; only to get the game home, begin playing it, and find out the game looks nothing like the commercial. With the power provided in Unreal Engine 3, this gap is a thing of the past.
<p />
<h2><a name="Camera Actor"></a> Camera Actor </h2>
<p />
The camera actor is used in Unreal Engine 3 as a virtual representation of a real-world camera. The currently active camera acts as the viewpoint through which the scene is rendered. Through the use of the Director track in Matinee, cameras can be cut between and faded in and out to create transitions much like those found in traditional films. Cameras can also zoom in and out to focus on specific areas or reveal more of the scene to the player. Each camera has its own set of post processing settings as well, which can be used to override the current post processing settings of the level, creating the possibilities for unique effects applicable only to each individual camera.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-004.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.4 – A Camera actor.</font></strong>
<p />
<h3><a name="Camera Actor Properties"></a> Camera Actor Properties </h3>
<p />
Camera actors have the following properties which can be used to modify the look of the scene as rendered from that camera.
<p />
<h4><a name="AspectRatio"></a> AspectRatio </h4>
<p />
This sets the ration of width to height of the rendered scene. Standard aspect ratios would be 1.33, which would be the aspect ratio of a standard television or computer monitor, and 1.78, which would be the aspect ratio of a widescreen television or computer monitor.
<p />
<h4><a name="b_ConstrainAspectRatio"></a> bConstrainAspectRatio </h4>
<p />
This determines whether the rendered scene will be restricted to the aspect ratio specified in the AspectRatio property, letter-boxing the extra space in the window if not the same aspect ratio as the camera, or if the rendered scene will simply fill the entire window regardless of the aspect ratio of the window or camera.
<p />
<h4><a name="FOVAngle"></a> FOVAngle </h4>
<p />
This sets the field of view, or the amount of degrees displayed, for the camera. Adjusting this will effectively cause the camera to zoom in or out.
<p />
<h4><a name="b_CamOverridePostProcess"></a> bCamOverridePostProcess </h4>
<p />
If true, the CamOverridePostProcess settings of this camera will override the current post process settings when this camera is active.
<p />
If false, the CamOverridePostProcess settings of this actor will be ignored.
<p />
<h4><a name="CamOverridePostProcess"></a> CamOverridePostProcess </h4>
<p />
This is a set of post process settings that will be used depending upon the bCamOverridePostProcess property of this camera. Complete descriptions of these properties can be found in Chapter 19: Post Process Effects.
<p />
<h2><a name="Camera Effects"></a> Camera Effects </h2>
<p />
<h3><a name="Real-world vs.  Virtual"></a> Real-world vs.  Virtual </h3>
<p />
As was mentioned previously, when you create a cinematic sequence you are essentially creating a virtual film that will be shown to the player during the game. One way to make these virtual films more interesting and believable is to add effects, such as depth of field or motion blur.  These effects would generally be created by traditional film cameras and lenses simply because of how they work and interact with the scene. Unreal Engine 3, through the use of post process effects and other features, takes the methods traditional filmmakers use and breaks them down into the individual parts in an attempt to mimic the film creation process. This makes knowledge of how effects are created using cameras and film extremely valuable when creating cinematic sequences within Unreal Engine 3.
<p />
<h3><a name="Depth of Field"></a> Depth of Field </h3>
<p />
Depth of field is used to give focus to objects at a certain depth while causing other objects to appear out of focus, or blurry. This can be a great way to direct the player's attention to a certain area in the scene. It can also be used to create the effect of the scene being viewed through a camera that loses focus or even through the eyes of the player as they wake up from sleeping or being knocked unconscious.
<p />
With cameras in the real world, depth of field is based on what is known as the F-number (often referred to as F-stops), or relative aperture. This is the ratio of the focal length of the lens to the diameter of the entrance pupil, or the entrance into the camera for the light. Increasing the f-number increases the depth of field effect, but also decreases the amount of light received.
<p />
In Unreal Engine 3, depth of field is caused by rendering objects at a certain distance, the FocusDistance, from the camera clearly, while applying a graduated blur effect to other objects in the scene out to the FocusInnerRadius. Unlike in the real-world, depth of field is not limited by light inside of Unreal Engine 3, but its main principles and its final result remain the same.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-005.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.5 – Here you can see the result of Depth of Field.</font></strong>
<p />
<h3><a name="Motion Blur"></a> Motion Blur </h3>
<p />
Motion blur makes objects in the scene which are moving in relation to the camera appeared blurred along their direction of movement. This can be used to exaggerate the amount of motion for objects in the scene or make that motion more apparent to the player. It can also be used to make abrupt camera movements more realistic.
<p />
In the real world, motion blur is based on the amount of incoming light and the length of time the film is exposed to that light. In essence, the film is capturing the scene, and thus the position of objects moving within the scene in relation to the camera, over a period of time as determined by the shutter speed. This gives those moving objects their blurred appearance.
<p />
In Unreal Engine 3, rendering the scene multiple times and compositing those renders into a single image for each frame is not feasible in order to keep the game running at an acceptable framerate. Instead, a graduated blur based on the rate of motion is applied to the area covered by moving objects, which when used wisely can give the appearance of motion that standard motion blur provides. This can be applied either to individual objects which are moving in the scene or to the entire scene, such as in a case where the camera is moving very quickly.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-006.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.6 – Motion blur causes this object to be blurred as it passes by the camera.</font></strong>
<p />
<h3><a name="Field of View"></a> Field of View </h3>
<p />
Field of view is the angular extent, or number of degrees, that can be seen by the camera at any one time. Adjusting the field of view is a way to zoom in on certain areas in the scene to show fine details or just the focus the player's attention on what they need to see.
<p />
When dealing with real world cameras, field of view is determined by the size of the film, the focal length of the lens being used, and the amount of distortion caused by that lens. Lenses are often classified in terms of their field of view, such as wide-angle or telephoto. Using lenses of these types, lenses would need to be swapped out to get different fields of view. There are also zoom lenses which allow their focal lengths to be adjusted producing a zooming effect.
<p />
In Unreal Engine 3, each camera has its own field of view setting called FOV.  The value of this property is the number of degrees the camera can see, just as with real cameras. The FOV of a camera can be adjusted during the cinematic to zoom in on characters or the environment when the player's attention is required.  Increasing the FOV gives the result of zooming out, and decreasing will zoom in.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-007.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.7 – These two shots show the camera zooming in through the use of FOV.</font></strong>
<p />
<h3><a name="Scene Effects"></a> Scene Effects </h3>
<p />
Scene effects are used to modify the color range, saturation, or contrast of the scene. This can be a great way to create specific moods or atmosphere in your cinematic sequence. Scene effects could be used to create a sepia-tone image or even something as simple as black and white. This could be used during a flashback to give a sense of time shifting or to evoke emotions or s sense of nostalgia. The possibilities are virtually limitless.
<p />
With traditional cameras and film, effects such as these are usually created by either directly manipulating the film during the developing process or through the use of lens filters. There are several kinds of filters available which can cancel out certain colors, boost specific colors, increase contrast, or perform a myriad of other functions.
<p />
Camera actors in Unreal Engine 3 give the designer control over the red, green, and blue channels of the lowlights, SceneShadows, and highlights, SceneHighlights, allowing individual color components to be boosted or limited. Control of the gamma curve, allowing contrast to be modified, is also provided through the SceneMidtones property. The entire scene can also be desaturated by adjusting the SceneDesaturation property.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-008.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.8 – On the left is the original shot; on the right, the same shot with scene effects applied.</font></strong>
<p />
<h3><a name="Image Separation through Lighting"></a> Image Separation through Lighting </h3>
<p />
With the improved graphical capabilities of Unreal Engine 3 and the consistent lighting across surfaces, it is much easier for the characters and environment to appear integrated into one coherent scene. At times, this almost works too well and the characters will blend into the scene so perfectly that they are difficult to distinguish. Separating the characters from the environment becomes important in situations like this and can be achieved using subtle lighting cues, such as rim lighting.
<p />
Rim lighting is basically creating highlights along the silhouette of the character using accent lights or shader setups. This not only creates a nice visual look, but draws the characters out of the scene just enough to keep them set as the focus of the scene. It is important to keep the effect subtle, though, as too much rim lighting can destroy the scene's sense of realism.
<p />
<h2><a name="DumpMovie Command"></a> DumpMovie Command </h2>
<p />
Unreal Engine 3 also provides the ability to render out each frame of the cinematic sequence to individual image files that can be composited into a single movie file in an external application. These standalone movie files could potentially be used for purpose of promoting a game or mod, taking legal issues into account of course, by making them available on the Internet or including them in commercials. The process is extremely simple once the cinematic is created. All you need to do is launch the game's executable file from the command line specifying the name of the map file the cinematic resides in followed by the -dumpmovie switch. This will cause a .BMP image file for each frame to be created inside of the Screenshots folder for the game. The -benchmark switch may also be used in addition to limit the game to running at 30 frames per second. If you wish to, you may also specify the resoultion to run the game at using the -ResX= and -ResY= switches. The full command would look something like this:
<p />
ExampleGame CinematicsDemo -dumpmovie -benchmark -resx=1280 -resy=720
<p />
This command would launch the ExampleGame running the CinematicsDemo map at a resolution of 1280x720 and at 30 frames per second while creating images of each frame.

Using the tools, techniques, and effects mentioned throughout this chapter along with good filmmaking sense and a flare for the dramatic, Unreal Engine 3 places the ability to create engaging stories with fully-developed characters, exciting gameplay, and film-quality visual progression directly in the hands of the designers. Cinematic sequences can take over a scene, be integrated into the scene, or be rendered out as frames by the game and composited into a standalone movie. The only real limitations are your own imagination and creativity.
<p />
<h2><a name="TUTORIAL 21.1 Character Setup"></a> TUTORIAL 21.1 Character Setup </h2>
<p />
Over the course of this set of tutorials, we are going to be creating a cinematic sequence, or cut-scene, in which the character will run down a hallway. Four explosions will occur knocking the player around on his way. The sequence will contain two camera cuts and the use of fades and slomo. We will also be modifying certain properties of the camera actors themselves, such as the depth of field post processing settings as well as the field of view, or FOV. The entire sequence will be backed by a musical score to give a more cinematic atmosphere.
<p />
<strong>1.</strong>	Open the Cinematics_Demo map. This map will be the scene for the cinematic sequence we are going to create. It consists of a long hallway which the character will be running down while being thrown about by explosions.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-009.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.9 – The map shows a relatively simple hallway.</font></strong>
<p />
<strong>2.</strong>	The first thing that needs to be done is place the character in the level. We will be using a special actor called SkeletalMeshActorMAT which allows for the blending of animations within Matinee. Select the COG_Grunt_AMesh asset from the COG_Grunt package in the Generic Browser. Then, right click on the floor of the hallway in the perspective viewport and choose Add Actor -&gt; SkeletalMeshActorMAT: SkeletalMesh COG_Grunt.COG_Grunt_AMesh to place the actor.
<p />
<strong>Note:</strong> The topic of blending animations is discussed in-depth in Chapter 20: Animation System.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-010.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.10 – Place the actor in the level.</font></strong>
<p />
<strong>3.</strong>	Move the character’s pivot so that it rests in the center of the hallway.  Note that this will cause the character to appear to be off to the side of the hallway.
<p />
<strong>4.</strong>	Select the actor and press F4 to open its properties.
<p />
<strong>5.</strong>	Under the Movement section, set the Physics property to PHYS_Interpolating. This will be necessary because we are going to use Matinee to control the movement of the player.
<p />
<strong>6.</strong>	Expand the SkeletalMeshActor section, then expand the LightEnvironment section and select the bEnabled property under LightEnvironmentComponent.
<p />
<strong>7.</strong>	Now, under the SkeletalMeshActor section, expand the SkeletalMeshComponent section, and finally, scroll down to the SkeletalMeshComponent subsection.
<p />
<strong>8.</strong>	Select the animTree_Grunt asset from the CinematicsDemoContent package in the Generic Browser. Then press the Use Current Selection in Browser button for the AnimTree property. This AnimTree is set up to allow for the blending of animations.
<p />
<strong>9.</strong>	Now, position the actor at the top end of the hallway looking at it in the Top viewport. It should be centered on the hallway in the Y-axis and about 144 units from the end of the hallway in the X-axis. Also, move the actor up so the mesh's feet are even with the floor of the hallway. Then, rotate it so the character is facing the opposite end.
<p />
Make sure that the pivot is in the center of the hallway, not the mesh.  If positioned properly, you should just barely see the character’s hand coming through the wall.
<p />

<h2><a name="TUTORIAL 21.2 Initial Kismet Setup"></a> TUTORIAL 21.2 Initial Kismet Setup </h2>
<p />
<strong>1.</strong>	Continuing from the previous tutorial, open the Cinematics_Demo map.
<p />
<strong>2.</strong>	We need to set up a network in Kismet that will toggle Cinematic Mode on and off, play the Matinee sequence, and hid the skeletal mesh actor once the animation is complete. Open Kismet and right-click in the workspace. Choose New Event -&gt; Level Startup.
<p />

<p />
<strong>3.</strong>	To the right of the Level Startup event, add a Toggle Cinemtaic Mode action by right-clicking and choosing New Action -&gt; Toggle -&gt; Toggle Cinematic Mode. The default settings for the properties of this action will work fine for our purposes. This action will disable all input and movement of the player and hide the player's mesh and the HUD.

<p />
<strong>7.</strong>	Select the Toggle Cinematic Mode and Player variable created earlier and duplicate them by pressing Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V. Disconnect any wires that run to the Matinee sequence, and move the new objects to the right of the Matinee. This action will unhide the player's mesh and the HUD as well as enabling input and movement, essentially returning to normal play.

<p />
<strong>Note:</strong> The matinee sequence object is going to grow considerably as we add new groups and tracks. It may be wise to move this and all subsequent sequence objects way off to the right or up or down to avoid overlapping.
<p />
<strong>8.</strong>	Connect the Completed link of the Matinee to the Disable link of the new Toggle Cinematic Mode action.
<p />
<strong>9.</strong>	To the right of the new Toggle Cinematic Mode action, right-click and choose New Action -&gt; Teleport. Connect it to the Out of the new Toggle Cinematic Mode, and connect the Player variable to the Target link of the Teleport. The teleport will place the player's mesh at the position of the mesh when the cinematic sequence ended.

<p />
<strong>6.</strong>	Move the time slider to Time=10.0 and press the Enter key to place a new key at that time. Right-click the new key and choose Interp Mode -&gt; Linear. This will cause the actor to move at a constant rate over the duration of the animation instead of easing in and out, or moving slowly at the beginning, speeding up through the center portion of the animation, and then slowing down near the end.
<p />
<strong>7.</strong>	Make sure the new key is selected by clicking on it. This puts the editor into the key editing mode which can be verified by looking for the text “ADJUST KEY 1” in the lower-left corner of the viewports as well as the appearance of “? KEY 1” in the lower-left corner of the Matinee Editor.
<p />
<strong>8.</strong>	In the viewports, the SkeletalMeshActorMAT should be selected automatically. Using the Top viewport, drag the actor to the opposite end of the hallway. You should see a curve appear in the viewport representing the path the actor will follow during the Matinee sequence.

<p />
<strong>2.</strong>	Open Kismet and double-click on the Matinee sequence to open the Matinee Editor.
<p />
<strong>3.</strong>	In this tutorial, we will create a track to control the DOF_FocusDistance property of Camera1. This will serve to keep the character in focus as it moves along the hallway. In order to do this, we need to know the distance between the character and the camera. A simple Kismet network will be created to display the distance as the character makes his way down the hallway. We will then use these values as guidelines to set keys for the track within Matinee in the following tutorial.
<p />
Right-click on the Camera1 group and choose Add New Float Property Track. Select the DOF_FocusDistance from the list of available properties in the dialog that appears and press OK. This will create a new track named Camera_DOF_FocusDistance.

<p />
<strong>Note:</strong> You may need to resize the dialog displaying the available properties as it can be quite small obscuring the names of the properties.
<p />
<strong>4.</strong>	Before we can begin placing keys, we really need some values to assign to those keys. As mentioned previously, using a network in Kismet will give us the values we need without resorting to guesswork.
<p />
In Kismet, create a Get Distance action to the right of and below the Level Startup event by right-clicking and choosing New Action -&gt; Actor -&gt; Get Distance.

<p />
<strong>1.</strong>	Continuing from the previous tutorial, open the Cinemtatics_Demo map.
<p />
<strong>2.</strong>	In the Image Separation Through Lighting section, using rim lighting was discussed as a way to subtly draw the characters out from the environment. You may have noticed over the course of the previous tutorials, that the character seems to almost disappear at times because of the darkness of the scene and the limited range of the color palette. In this tutorial, we are going to add in some accent lights, three to be exact, to give the character some highlights in order to distinguish him from the background.

<p />
<strong>7.</strong>	Holding down the Alt key to create a duplicate, move the light 224 units in the positive Y direction. This should create a new light to the character's left.
<p />
<strong>8.</strong>	Holding down the Alt key again to create a duplicate, move the new light 544 units in the negative X direction. This should create a new light in front of the character and to his left side.

<h2><a name="TUTORIAL 21.22 Explosion Particle Effects, Part I: Placing Emitters"></a> TUTORIAL 21.22 Explosion Particle Effects, Part I: Placing Emitters </h2>
<p />
<strong>1.</strong>	Continuing from the previous tutorial, open the Cinematics_Demo map.
<p />
<strong>2.</strong>	At this point, we have successfully set up the skeleton of the cinematic sequence, but it is still pretty boring at this point. There just isn't really anything happening. We need to add some meat, or action, to those bones. In the explanation of the series of tutorials, some explosions were mentioned. It is now time to begin adding those in to make the sequence more dynamic and exciting.
<p />
In the generic Browser, select the part_explosion asset from the CinematicsDemoContent package. Then, right-click in the viewport and choose Add Actor -&gt; Emitter: part_explosion.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-077.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.77 – Add a new emitter actor.</font></strong>
<p />
<strong>3.</strong>	The question of where to place the emitter comes up next. The positioning really depends on the timing of when the explosion is supposed to occur. This can be very subjective and based on personal preference of what feels right. For these tutorials, the timing of the explosions was worked out ahead of time and those will be used. As always, feel free to experiment on your own.
<p />
The first explosion will take place just after the character passes the control boxes at the half-way point of the hallway. These control boxes are found at several points along the hallway, and are designated by the red and green lights in front of them.  This is where the first emitter will be placed.
<p />
Position the emitter centered on the control box on the left side of the hallway looking in the Top viewport (this would be to the character's right as he passes it). It may help to open Matinee and move the time slider to Time=4.3. Then, you can find the player's position in the viewport and the control box should be right there to his right.  If for some reason the player has not yet reached the control box (or is already beyond it), simply close Matinee, then reposition the skeletal mesh in the X axis to change his starting location.  However, you will likely want to tweak the camera’s position as well if you do this.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-078.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.78 – Position the emitter on the control box.</font></strong>
<p />
<strong>4.</strong>	With the emitter selected, press F4 to open its properties. De-select bAutoActivate so the emitter will not initially be emitting particles. The emitters for the explosions will be triggered via Matinee in subsequent tutorials.
<p />
<strong>5.</strong>	With the emitter still selected, set the DrawScale3D setting at the bottom of the UnrealEd interface to 4.0.  This will make the explosion four times larger than its original size.
<p />
<strong>6.</strong>	Hold down the Alt key and drag the emitter across the hallway to create a duplicate. Now, move the time slider in Matinee to Time=4.7 and find the player's position at that time. There is a support beam to his left and some metal tubing that runs behind the support. Position the new emitter where the tubing and the support meet.

<p />
<strong>7.</strong>	Hold down the Alt key again and drag the emitter back to the other side of the hallway creating another duplicate. Move the time slider in Matinee to Time=5.075 and find the position of the player at that time in the viewports. There should be a row of four terminals to the player's right. Position the emitter at the second terminal in the row.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-080.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.80 – The third emitter should go at the second terminal.</font></strong>
<p />
<strong>8.</strong>	Hold down Alt yet again and drag the emitter to the opposite side of the hallway creating a fourth emitter. Move the time slider in Matinee to Time=5.45 and find the player in the viewports. To the player's left is another support beam with a pipe running behind it along the ceiling. Position the last emitter 64 units below where the pipe meets the support beam. The emitter is moved down 64 units because it would barely be seen based on the angle of the camera at that point during the cinematic. This assures that it is seen by the player.

You can easily fix this by keying each emitter to be off when the sequence starts.  Using the skills you have gained so far, add a key at Time=0 for each emitter, switching them off at the beginning of the sequence.

<h2><a name="TUTORIAL 21.28 Evasion Animation Track, Part II: Curve Adjustment"></a> TUTORIAL 21.28 Evasion Animation Track, Part II: Curve Adjustment </h2>
<p />
<strong>1.</strong>	Continuing from the previous tutorial, open the Cinematics_Demo map.
<p />
<strong>2.</strong>	Open Kismet and double-click the Matinee sequence to open the Matinee Editor.
<p />
<strong>3.</strong>	Now that the keys for playing the individual animations are in place, we need to adjust the curve for this track so that its animations will override those of the base animation track.
<p />
Send the second Anim Control track's curve information to the Curve Editor by clicking the little box in the lower-right corner of the track and open the Curve Editor by pressing the Toggle Curve Editor button in the toolbar.  Currently, the curve will appear as a straight line.
<p />
<strong>4.</strong>	Create a point on the curve at Time=0.0 with a value of 0.0 by holding the Ctrl key and left-clicking on the curve. With this point selected, press the Constant tangent button in the Curve Editor's toolbar.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-097.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.97 – Create a constant key at Time=0.0.</font></strong>
<p />
<strong>5.</strong>	Create a new point on the curve at Time=4.3 by holding the Ctrl key and left-clicking on the curve. Right-click on the point and choose Set value. Set the value of the point to 1.0. With this point selected, press the Linear tangent button in the Curve Editor's toolbar.
<p />
This will cause the animations of this track to override the base animations starting at Time=4.3, which is the time of the first explosion.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-098.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.98 – The animation on this track will now override the base run track created earlier.</font></strong>
<p />
<strong>6.</strong>	Create a new point on the curve at Time=5.75 and a value of 1.0 by holding the Ctrl key and left-clicking on the curve.
<p />
<strong>7.</strong>	Create a new point on the curve at Time=5.85 by holding the Ctrl key and left-clicking on the curve. Right-click on the point and choose Set Value. Set the value of this point to 0.0.
<p />
This will cause the animations of this track to blend back to the base animation after the last explosion.
<p />
<strong>8.</strong>	Create a new point on the curve at Time=10.0 by holding the Ctrl key and left-clicking on the curve. Right-click on the point and choose Set Value. Set the value of this point to 1.0.
<p />
This will cause the running animation of this track to slowly blend in with the base running animation over a period of time creating a slow motion type effect that only effects the character.
<p />
<img src="rsrc/Three/MasteringUnrealCinematicSequences/21-099.jpg"/><br/> <strong><font color=blue>FIGURE 21.99 – The final curve should look something like this.</font></strong>
<p />
<strong>9.</strong>	Make sure the realtime preview is enabled in the perspective viewport and press the Play button in Matinee. The character should be playing a running animation as he runs down the hallway, but when the explosions occur, he should perform a roll to the left, then a roll to the right, then a roll to the left, and finally a somersault forward. The character's animation should also blend from a full-speed run to a slow run after the explosions.

In the end, creating a cinematic sequence is an inexact science.  Even as you progress through these tutorials, you will likely find areas where it might make more sense to go your own way and make small tweaks or even major changes.  It will depend on where you place certain objects, the timing of your animation, and above all, your own sense of style.  Feel free to experiment and make adjustments as you need to, and of course, make sure you practice.  Plus if you want to become an effective storyteller, remember that even though you’re in Unreal, you’re essentially a cinematographer.  It will help to study cinematography and storytelling through video.
