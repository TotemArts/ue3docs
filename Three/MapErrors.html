<h2><a name="Overview"></a> Overview </h2>
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"><hr size="1" noshade="noshade"></div>
<p />
Unreal Engine 3 provides a mechanism for alerting you to potential problems in the form of map check errors and warnings instead of having to hunt down issues manually without knowing what is causing the problem or how to fix it. These errors are an automated way to find out where problems lie and allows you to get them fixed before they have a serious impact on your game.
<p />
<h2><a name="Performing a Map Check"></a> Performing a Map Check </h2>
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"><hr size="1" noshade="noshade"></div>
<p />
Map check errors and warnings are displayed following performing a build all of a map and can also be performed separately using the <em>Check Map for Errors...</em> option in the <em>Tools</em> menu.
<p />
<h2><a name="Errors"></a> Errors </h2>
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"><hr size="1" noshade="noshade"></div>
<p />
Errors are critical problems that can potentially cause execution failure. These need to be fixed before proceeding.
<p />
<h3><a name="Crowd"></a> Crowd </h3>
<p />
<a name="SharesQueuePoint"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Shares a QueuePoint [CrowdDestination] with [OtherCrowdDestination]</strong> </dt><dd> Queues cannot have shared QueuePoints.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<h3><a name="Lighting"></a> Lighting </h3>
<p />
<a name="MultipleDominantLights"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Maps have multiple dominant lights affecting one primitive, these will show up red in lighting complexity and render incorrectly on consoles.</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when a map has more than one dominant light which affects the same primitive. Primitives are only supposed to be lit by a single dominant light at any time.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="MultipleDomDirectionalLights"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Multiple DominantDirectionalLights detected, please delete all but one!</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when there is more than one DominantDirectionalLight in the level. Only one is allowed. This problem can be fixed by deleting all but one of the DominantDirectionalLights.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="MatchingLightGUID"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[LightActor] has same light GUID as [LightActor] (Duplicate and replace the orig with the new one)</strong> </dt><dd> Duplicate and replace the original with the new one.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="DynamicLightEnvironmentEnabledComponentsNotAcceptingLights"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Dynamic Light Environment enabled but only used on components with bAcceptsLights=False! The DLE should be disabled</strong> </dt><dd> The Dynamic Light Environment should be disabled.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<h3><a name="Linker"></a> Linker </h3>
<p />
<a name="SavedWithNewerVersion"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Package '[Package]' has been saved with engine version newer than current and therefore won't be possible to save. CurrEngineVersion&#58; [EngineVersion]  VersionSavedWith&#58; [EngineVersion]</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when a package (content or map) is attempted to be opened with a version of the engine older than the engine version the package was saved with. The package may still open depending on incompatibilities between the two engine versions, but the package will not be allowed to be subsequently saved if any changes are made to its contents.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<h3><a name="Navigation"></a> Navigation </h3>
<p />
<a name="PylonOutsideBounds"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Pylon is outside its expansion bounds!</strong> </dt><dd> The expansion bounds for this pylon may need updating.

<p />
<a name="PylonGroundPosOutsideBounds"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Pylon's ground position is outside its expansion bounds - this pylon will not build paths</strong> </dt><dd> The expansion bounds for this pylon may need updating.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="PylonNoGroundPos"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Could not find ground position for pylon - this pylon will not build paths</strong> </dt><dd> A ground position should be set for this pylon.
</dd></dl>

<a name="PylonsInsideEachOther"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[Pylon] and [Pylon] are inside each other's bounds! One pylon can be in another's bounds, but not both</strong> </dt><dd> TODO
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="NegativeOrZeroDistance"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Negative or zero distance to [Navigation Point]!</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when there is a navigation point with negative or zero distance to another navigation point.  This can be problematic because this case should be impossible to achieve and is usually the result of a path building error.  This error can be resolved by rebuilding paths.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="NotReachableFromAll"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Cannot reach [Navigation Point] from this node!</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when there is a NavigationPoint with bMustBeReachable set to TRUE that is unreachable from some other node.  This is usually the result of placing the node in a location that cannot be reached by the AI and can be solved by either setting the bMustBeReachable flag to FALSE or moving the navigation point to a location that is reachable by all other navigation points.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="NavPointBadBase"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>This type of NavigationPoint cannot be based on [Actor]</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when there is a NavigationPoint on a base that it is not compatible with.  This is usually the result of placing a normal navigation point on a non-static base.  This error can be fixed by placing the navigation point over a static base and using a specialized navigation point for dynamic bases (such as a LiftCenter for lifts).
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="NeedMorePlayerstarts"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Only XX PlayerStarts in this level (need at least YY)</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when there is a required amount of player starts and the map contains less than the required amount.  This will keep the map from being playable.  To solve this problem, add more player starts to the level or reduce the required amount of player starts by modifying the default value of MinNumPlayerStarts for the Scout class used by your game.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="NavPointLocationInvalid"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Navigation point not on valid base, or too close to steep slope</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when there is a path node that is not on a floor or is near a wall or other steep slope.  This is a problem because actors will be unable to properly travel to the node's location.  This error can be fixed by moving the navigation point to a valid location.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="PlayerStartInvalid"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>PlayerStart is not useable</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when a PlayerStart actor is in a invalid location.  This is a problem because the spawning code cannot safely place a player actor there without falling off the world or placing the player into a obstacle.  This error can be fixed by moving the player start to a valid location.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="NoLiftExit"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>No LiftExits associated with this LiftCenter</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when there is a LiftCenter actor without a corresponding LiftExit.  LiftCenter actor's are used to help AI pawns navigate lifts properly by telling them where a safe place to stand on the lift is.  LiftExit's help identify where the AI pawn should exit a lift.  Having a LiftCenter without a corresponding LiftExit keeps the AI from knowing how to properly exit a lift.  This error can be fixed by adding a LiftExit actor if one doesn't already exist and then associating it with the LiftCenter actor by going to the LiftExit actor's Property Window-&gt;Lift Exit Category and setting the MyLiftCenter to be the LiftCenter actor.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="NoLiftCenter"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>No LiftCenter associated with this LiftExit</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when there is a LiftExit actor without a corresponding LiftCenter.  LiftCenter actor's are used to help AI pawns navigate lifts properly by telling them where a safe place to stand on the lift is.  LiftExit's help identify where the AI pawn should exit a lift.  Having a LiftCenter without a corresponding LiftExit keeps the AI from knowing how to properly exit a lift.  This error can be fixed by adding a LiftCenter actor if one doesn't already exist and then associating it with the LiftExit actor by going to the LiftExit actor's Property Window-&gt;Lift Exit Category and setting the MyLiftCenter to be the LiftCenter actor.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="ExtraCostZero"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Extra Cost cannot be less than zero!</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when there is a NavigationPoint derived actor with a Extra Cost property that is less than zero.  This can be problematic because Extra Cost is used to make a path less likely to be taken by the AI, but when it is less than zero it can cause problems in the navigation tree since it makes a path more likely to be taken.  This error can be fixed by going to the actor's Property Window-&gt;Navigation Point Category and setting Extra Cost to a value that is greater than or equal to zero.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="PortalMarkerFailed"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Failed to add PortalMarker!</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when a PortalTeleporter actor is unable to create a portal marker for AI path finding.  A portal marker is used to figure out the location of an actor after they have teleported and have fallen to the ground.  This error is usually the result of being unable to place a portal marker on a floor directly below the teleporter and can be resolved by moving the teleporter to a spot where there is a valid floor or creating a floor under the teleporter.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="DoorMarkerNoDoor"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>DoorMarker with no door</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when there is a DoorMarker without a corresponding door.  DoorMarker's are used by AI pawns to properly path find their way through doors.  This error is the result of creating a door marker without assigning a door to it and can be resolved by going to the DoorMarker actor's Property Window-&gt;DoorMarker Category and setting 'MyDoor' property.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="NoNavigationPoints"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>No navigation point list. Paths define needed.</strong> </dt><dd> This error is caused when the path data isn't completely built.  This can be problematic because AI pathing will not work correctly when the game is run.  This warning can be resolved by rebuilding paths.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="PathNodeInvalidGUID"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>Nav [Navigation] has an invalid GUID.  You may need to rebuild paths</strong> </dt><dd> Invalid GUID found - this may be an indication that paths need rebuilding.

<h2><a name="Warnings"></a> Warnings </h2>
<div style="margin-top:-10px;"><hr size="1" noshade="noshade"></div>
<p />
Warnings are issues which, while not critical, can cause your game to not function properly or with sub-optimal performance. These should be addressed but are not showstoppers.
<p />
<h3><a name="Actor"></a> Actor </h3>
<p />
<a name="ActorInSameLocation"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>'[Actor]' in same location as '[Actor]'</strong> </dt><dd> <strong>Temporarily Remove From Code?</strong> - two actors are placed in the same location.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="ActorLargeShadowCaster"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[Actor] &#58; Large actor casts a shadow and will cause an extreme performance hit unless bUseBooleanEnvironmentShadowing is set to TRUE</strong> </dt><dd> A large actor has been set to cast shadows - this will cause extreme performance issues and should have bUseBooleanEnvironmentShadowing set to TRUE.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="StaticFalse"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[Actor] bStatic false, but is bStatic by default - map will fail in netplay</strong> </dt><dd> This warning is caused when there is an actor that had its bStatic property set to false even though the default is true.  This warning is usually seen in older maps when bStatic used to be modifyable by level designers and can cause problems in network play since certain assumptions are made about actors that default bStatic to true.  Since bStatic is no longer modifyable through the editor, this warning can be fixed by deleting the actor and recreating it.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="NoDeleteFalse"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[Actor] bNoDelete false, but is bNoDelete by default - map will fail in netplay</strong> </dt><dd> This warning is caused when there is an actor that had its bNoDelete property set to false even though the default is true.  This warning is usually seen in older maps when bNoDelete used to be modifyable by level designers and can cause problems in network play since certain assumptions are made about actors that default bNoDelete to true.  Since bNoDelete is no longer modifyable through the editor, this warning can be fixed by deleting the actor and recreating it.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="NoDamageType"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[Volume] causes damage, but has no damagetype defined.</strong> </dt><dd> This warning is caused when there is a volume that is set to cause damage but doesn't have a damage type defined.  A damage type is important because it tells the game code how to handle a actor's reaction to taking damage.  This can be solved by going to the actor's Property Window-&gt;Physics Volume and setting the 'DamageType' property.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="NonCoPlanarPolys"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[Actor] &#58; Brush has non-coplanar polygons</strong> </dt><dd> This warning is caused when there is a brush in the level that has non-coplanar polygons.  This is usually caused by using brush editing tools in geometry mode in extreme ways and can cause missing polygons in the level.  This warning can be resolved by deleting the brush and recreating it.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="SameLocation"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[Actor] in same location as [Another Actor]</strong> </dt><dd> This warning is caused when there is a actor that is in the same exact location as another actor.  This warning is usually the result of a accidental duplication or paste operation.  It can be fixed by deleting one of the actors, or disregarded if the placement was intentional.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="InvalidDrawscale"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[Actor] has invalid DrawScale/ DrawScale3D</strong> </dt><dd> This warning is caused when either DrawScale, DrawScale3D X, DrawScale3D Y, or DrawScale 3D Z is equal to zero.  Meaning that the actor will not be shown because it is being scaled to zero on one of its axis.  To solve this problem, change any DrawScale's that are zero to be non-zero by selecting the actor and changing its drawscale at the bottom of the main UnrealEd window.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="ActorIsObselete"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[Actor] is obsolete and must be removed!</strong> </dt><dd> This warning is caused when there is an instance of a actor in a level that has been marked deprecated.  This is usually because a actor was marked deprecated after the level was created, but the map was never updated.  This can be fixed by simply deleting the actor.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="StaticPhysNone"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[Actor] bStatic true, but has Physics set to something other than PHYS_None!</strong> </dt><dd> This warning is caused when an actor has its bStatic flag set to true but its Physics is set to PHYS_None.  Since bStatic means that the actor will not be moving, having Physics set to PHYS_None is contradictory.  Actors set with the bStatic flag are also not ticked(updated).  This error can be solved by going to the actor's properties and changing its Physics to PHYS_None.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="NotPlaceable"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[Actor] is not placeable and should be removed!!!</strong> </dt><dd> This warning is caused when there is a instance of a non-placeable object in a map.  Usually this is caused when a object that was originally placeable is changed to be non-placeable.  This error can be solved by deleting the object using the map check dialog.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="CylinderComponentNull"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>NavigationPoint has NULL CylinderComponent - please delete!</strong> </dt><dd> This warning is caused when there is a NavigationPoint with a "None" CylinderComponent.  It is usually found in older maps where duplication was used to create the actor and can be fixed by deleting the actor causing the warning and creating a new one.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="VolumeActorCollisionComponentNULL"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[Actor] &#58; Volume actor has NULL collision component - please delete</strong> </dt><dd> The specified volume actor has a NULL collision component and should probably be deleted.
</dd></dl>
<p />
<a name="VolumeActorZeroRadius"></a> <dl>
<dt> <strong>[Actor] &#58; Volume actor has a collision component with 0 radius - please delete</strong> </dt><dd> The specified volume actor has a zero radius for its collision component and should probably be deleted.
